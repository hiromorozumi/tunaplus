Tuna+
=====

This is: version 0.1.0

This program started out as a project to build a software tuner. Then I decided to add other useful functionalities like a metronome. I plan to add a few more things like a voice recorder and a 1-octave piano. I'm aiming to build a compact suite of desktop tools that do helpful tasks for musicians. Runs on Windows machines, XP and later. It's very much a work in progress, but at least I got the tuner and the metronome functions working well. If you test out this app, you're welcome to let me know what you think and what features you would like to see added! :)

Sincerely,
